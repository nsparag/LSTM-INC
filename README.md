# LSTM-INC

The work aims at performing sensor fusion for the application of Attitude Estimation using the LSTM framework and follow the incremental learning mechanism for weights update and prediction

The different files present are:

1. LSTM_Attitude_Estimation_Incremental.ipynb is the Main Code file for proposed LSTM-inc

2. model.png is the graphical representation of the model

3. Dataset files: D1.xlsx, D2.xlsx, D3.xlsx, D4.xlsx, D5.xlsx, D6.xlsx

4. ekf_attitude estimation.m is the Extended Kalman Filter implementation for attitude estimation
